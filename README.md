# BesoksBuddy
Kode til BesoksBuddy

Besoksbuddy was a project by me and my fellow students in IN1060. 
The goal of the project was to understand why the elderly had problems with communcating with eachother during the COVID-lockdown.

This is the code that ran on an Arduino to power our high-fidelity prototype. As this is a prototype, not all functionality is implemented.
